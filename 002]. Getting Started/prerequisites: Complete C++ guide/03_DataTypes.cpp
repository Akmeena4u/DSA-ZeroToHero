/*
Data Types in C++
Data Type: A set of values together with a set of operations.
types of datatype -->
1.primitive datatype --> int, float,double, char, bool ,widechar ,void
2.derived datatype --> Array , pointers , function, reference
3.userdefined datatype--> class , structure , union , enum ,typedef

sizeof operator â€” sizeof operator is used to find the number of bytes occupied by a variable/data type in computer memory
