/*

Whenever we see a circular number game then we must need to think about three things 
1- mod solution (0 to n-1)
2- doubly ended queue 
3- double ll/ circular ll


In this type of  questions when we don't see anything then we need to try recursion by below steps 
First take small example on then gradually increase example and observe pattern
