### Complete Guide On Complexity Analysis – Data Structure and Algorithms Tutorial

#### **Introduction to Complexity Analysis**
- Complexity analysis is a technique used to characterize the time taken by an algorithm with respect to input size. This technique is independent of the machine, language, and compiler. It is essential for evaluating the variations in execution time across different algorithms.

#### **Why Complexity Analysis is Needed?**
- **Resource Requirement**: Determines the amount of time and space resources needed to execute an algorithm.
- **Comparison**: Used for comparing different algorithms on various input sizes.
- **Problem Difficulty**: Helps determine the difficulty level of a problem.
- **Measurement**: Measures how much time and space (memory) it takes to solve a particular problem.

### **Measuring Complexity**

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Measures the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.

3. **Auxiliary Space**:
   - The extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

### **Types of Complexity**

1. **Constant Complexity (O(1))**:
   - Time remains constant regardless of input size.

2. **Logarithmic Complexity (O(log n))**:
   - Time increases logarithmically as input size increases.

3. **Linear Complexity (O(n))**:
   - Time increases linearly with the input size.

4. **Quadratic Complexity (O(n^2))**:
   - Time increases quadratically with the input size.

5. **Factorial Complexity (O(n!))**:
   - Time increases factorially with the input size.

6. **Exponential Complexity (O(2^n))**:
   - Time increases exponentially with the input size.
