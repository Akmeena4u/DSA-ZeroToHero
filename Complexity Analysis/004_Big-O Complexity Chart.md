### **Big-O Complexity Chart**

| Performance | Time Complexity          |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Excellent   | O(1), O(log n)           |
| Good        | O(n)                     |
| Fair        | O(n log n)               |
| Bad         | O(n^2)                   |
| Horrible    | O(2^n), O(n!)            |
