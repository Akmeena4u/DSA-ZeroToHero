### Problem Understanding

You are given an integer `k` and a matrix `mat`. The task is to rotate the matrix to the left `k` times and return the resulting matrix.

**Example:**

- **Input:**
  - `k = 1`
  - `mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`

- **Output:**
  - After rotating the matrix to the left once, the output should be:
  ```
  2 3 1
  5 6 4
  8 9 7
  ```

### Approach

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Matrix Dimensions:**
   - Determine the number of rows (`row`) and columns (`col`) in the matrix.

2. **Create a New Matrix:**
   - Initialize a new matrix `v` of the same dimensions as the input matrix `mat`.

3. **Rotation Logic:**
   - For each element in the matrix, compute its new position after `k` rotations to the left.
   - To find the new position of an element after `k` left rotations:
     - The element in the `j-th` column of a row will move to `(j + k) % col` position in the same row.
   - This uses the modulo operator to handle cases where the index goes beyond the last column, wrapping around to the beginning of the row.

### Implementation

Here's the C++ code to achieve this:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> rotateMatrix(int k, vector<vector<int>> mat) {
        int row = mat.size();
        int col = mat[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> v(row, vector<int>(col, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; ++j) {
                v[i][j] = mat[i][(j + k) % col];
            }
        }
        return v;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Matrix Dimensions:**
   - `row` stores the number of rows in the matrix `mat`.
   - `col` stores the number of columns in the matrix `mat`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A new matrix `v` of size `row x col` is initialized with all elements set to 0.

3. **Rotation Process:**
   - Iterate through each element of the original matrix `mat` using nested loops:
     - The outer loop runs from `0` to `row-1` to cover all rows.
     - The inner loop runs from `0` to `col-1` to cover all columns.
   - For each element at position `(i, j)` in `mat`, calculate its new position in `v`:
     - `v[i][j] = mat[i][(j + k) % col]`
     - Here, `(j + k) % col` computes the new column index after `k` rotations to the left, ensuring it wraps around using modulo.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The rotated matrix `v` is returned as the output.

### Notes

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in `O(row * col)` time, as it processes each element of the matrix once.
- **Space Complexity:** The additional space used is `O(row * col)` for the new matrix `v`.

This approach ensures that the matrix is rotated efficiently and correctly for any given number of rotations `k`.
