1. **Problem Description**: The problem is about finding the number of paths on a mobile numeric keypad starting from any key and moving in four directions (up, down, left, right) without diagonals.

2. **Visualization**: The numeric keypad is visualized as a 3x4 matrix, where each cell represents a key. Diagonal movements are not allowed, and some keys are not accessible.

3. **Movement Rules**:
   - Up: (i - 1, j)
   - Down: (i + 1, j)
   - Left: (i, j - 1)
   - Right: (i, j + 1)

4. **Boundary Conditions**: Invalid paths are encountered when moving outside the boundaries or encountering specific keys like "*" or "#".

5. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize a count variable for valid paths.
   - Iterate through all keys on the keypad.
   - If a valid starting key is found, call a recursive function to explore paths from that key.
   - Return the count of valid paths.

6. **Recursive Function**:
   - Parameters: current keypad position, remaining steps, matrix to track visited keys.
   - Base Cases:
     - If remaining steps are 0, increment the count and return.
     - If the current position is invalid (outside boundaries or prohibited key), return.
   - Recursive Calls:
     - Explore all four directions recursively, decrementing remaining steps.
     - Mark the current position as visited to avoid revisiting.
   - Backtrack: Mark the current position as unvisited after exploring all directions.

7. **Implementation**:
   - Define the keypad matrix and initialize the count variable.
   - Implement the recursive function to explore paths.
   - Handle boundary conditions and prohibited keys.
   - Start the recursive exploration from each valid key on the keypad.
   - Return the count of valid paths.

Overall, the solution involves visualization of the keypad as a matrix, defining movement rules, handling boundary conditions, and implementing a recursive approach to explore valid paths.
