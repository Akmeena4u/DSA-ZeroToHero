### Problem Description:
You are given a circular sheet with a radius r. The task is to find the total number of rectangles with integral length and width that can be cut from the sheet and fit on the circle, one at a time.

### Example:
- If r = 1, there is only one rectangle of dimensions `1* 1` that fits within the circle.
- If r = 2, there are 8 possible rectangles: `(1*1), (1*2), (1*3), (2*1), (2*2), (2*3), (3*1), (3*2)`.

### Intuition
The intuition behind the solution lies in understanding how rectangles can fit within a circle and how to systematically count them.

1. **Bounding Box**: First, realize that the largest rectangle that can fit within a circle is a square whose diagonal is equal to the diameter of the circle. This square will be the bounding box for all possible rectangles within the circle.

2. **Iteration**: The solution iterates through all possible lengths and widths of rectangles within the bounding box. Since the rectangle's sides must be integers, the iteration ranges from 1 to 2r (where r is the radius of the circle).

3. **Checking Validity**: For each combination of length l and width  w, it checks if the rectangle fits within the circle. This check is done using the condition  `l^2 + w^2<= 4r^2`. If this condition is satisfied, the rectangle is valid and counted.

4. **Counting**: The solution increments the count for each valid rectangle, eventually giving the total number of rectangles that can fit within the circle.

5. **Efficiency**: By using this systematic iteration and validity check, the solution avoids unnecessary calculations and efficiently counts the valid rectangles within the circle.

Overall, the intuition is to leverage the geometric properties of circles and rectangles to systematically count the valid rectangles within the given circle, ensuring that they have integral lengths and widths.


### Approach:
The approach involves iterating through all possible rectangle dimensions within the circle and counting the valid rectangles.

### Code Explanation:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rectanglesInCircle(int r) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int l = 1; l <= 2 * r; l++) {
            for (int w = 1; w <= 2 * r; w++) {
                if (l * l + w * w <= 4 * r * r) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize the `count` variable to track the number of valid rectangles.
2. Iterate through all possible lengths and widths within the range `[1, 2 * r]`.
3. For each combination of length `l` and width `w`, check if the rectangle fits within the circle using the condition `l^2 + w^2 <= 4r^2`.
4. If the condition is met, increment the `count` variable.
5. Return the final count of valid rectangles.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- Time Complexity: The time complexity of the solution is `O(r^2)` due to nested loops iterating up to  2r.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is `O(1)` as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of rectangles that can fit within the given circle with integral length and width.
