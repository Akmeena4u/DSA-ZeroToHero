### Problem Statement:
Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, the task is to transform `str1` into `str2` by performing the minimum number of operations. The allowed operations are:
- **Insertion** of a character.
- **Deletion** of a character.

### Examples:
1. **Input**: `str1 = "heap"`, `str2 = "pea"`
   - **Output**: 3
   - **Explanation**: We delete 'h' and 'a' from "heap" and then insert 'p' at the beginning, resulting in "pea". The total operations are 2 deletions and 1 insertion.

2. **Input**: `str1 = "geeksforgeeks"`, `str2 = "geeks"`
   - **Output**: 8
   - **Explanation**: We delete "forgeeks" from "geeksforgeeks", resulting in "geeks". The total operations are 8 deletions.

### Approach:

#### Step 1: Understand the Core Concept
The key to solving this problem efficiently is to first identify the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** between the two strings. The LCS gives us the longest sequence that can appear in both `str1` and `str2` without changing the order of characters.

- If we know the LCS, we can determine:
  - How many characters in `str1` need to be deleted to align with the LCS.
  - How many characters need to be inserted into `str1` to transform it into `str2`.

#### Step 2: Compute the LCS
The LCS can be computed using dynamic programming (DP). The basic idea is:
- If the characters at the current positions in `str1` and `str2` match, then the LCS at this point is 1 plus the LCS of the previous characters.
- If they don't match, the LCS will be the maximum of either:
  - Ignoring the current character in `str1`.
  - Ignoring the current character in `str2`.

The DP table `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS for the substrings `str1[0..i-1]` and `str2[0..j-1]`.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Operations
Once the LCS is known:
- **Deletions** needed = `Length of str1` - `Length of LCS`
- **Insertions** needed = `Length of str2` - `Length of LCS`

The total operations are the sum of these deletions and insertions.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int LCS(std::string str1, std::string str2, int m, int n)  {
    // Create a DP table to store lengths of longest common subsequence
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m + 1, std::vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

    // Build the DP table
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)  {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)  {
            if (str1[i-1] == str2[j-1])
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
            else
                dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j]);
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}

int minOperations(std::string str1, std::string str2) 
{ 
    int m = str1.length();
    int n = str2.length();

    // Find the LCS length
    int lcs = LCS(str1, str2, m, n);

    // Calculate the number of deletions and insertions
    int num_removed = m - lcs;
    int num_inserted = n - lcs;

    return num_removed + num_inserted;
} 
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **LCS Function**:
  - We initialize a 2D vector `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` with zeros. This table will store the LCS values for substrings of `str1` and `str2`.
  - We iterate over each character of `str1` and `str2` and fill the DP table based on the matching of characters.
  - If characters match, the current cell value is `1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`.
  - If characters don't match, we take the maximum of the values from the left or above cells in the DP table.
  - The final LCS length is stored in `dp[m][n]`.

- **minOperations Function**:
  - We calculate the LCS using the helper function `LCS`.
  - We then calculate the number of deletions and insertions required by subtracting the LCS length from the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.
  - The total operations required are returned as the sum of deletions and insertions.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of `str1` and `n` is the length of `str2`. This is because we are filling a DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` due to the storage required for the DP table.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations needed to transform `str1` into `str2`.
