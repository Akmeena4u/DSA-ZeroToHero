### **Problem explanation: Maximize The Cut Segments**

The problem statement asks us to maximize the number of segments we can cut from a line segment of length `n`, where each cut can only be of length `x`, `y`, or `z`. The goal is to make as many cuts as possible, and if no valid cuts can be made, return `0`.

#### **Key Points:**
- We are given a line segment of length `n`.
- We have three possible lengths (`x`, `y`, `z`) we can use to cut the segment.
- We need to find the maximum number of cuts that can be made such that the total length equals `n`.
- If no valid cuts can be made, we return `0`.

#### **Example:**
```plaintext
Input: n = 4, x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: We can make four cuts each of length 1 (y or z).
```

### **Pattern: Unbounded Knapsack (DP Problem)**

This problem follows a pattern similar to the **Unbounded Knapsack** problem, where:
- We can repeatedly choose one of the available cut lengths (`x`, `y`, or `z`).
- We need to maximize the number of selections (cuts) such that the total sum equals `n`.
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is suitable here because we need to make decisions at each step and reuse previously computed results for subproblems.

### **Approach: Recursive + Dynamic Programming (Top-Down Memoization)**

We will solve this problem using a recursive approach combined with **memoization** to store intermediate results.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Recursive Structure**:
    - At any point, we have three choices: cut a segment of length `x`, `y`, or `z`.
    - We recursively reduce the remaining length by one of these cut lengths until the total equals `n`.

2. **Base Cases**:
    - If `sum == n`, we have achieved the desired total length, so we return `0` (no further cuts are needed).
    - If `sum > n`, it is not a valid solution, so return `INT_MIN` (representing an invalid state).

3. **Memoization**:
    - To avoid recomputation, we store the result of each subproblem in a `dp[]` array. This way, if we encounter the same problem again, we can simply return the stored result.

4. **Result**:
    - If the final result is negative, it indicates that no valid cuts could be made, so we return `0`. Otherwise, return the maximum number of cuts made.

### **Code:**

```cpp
int solve(int n, int x, int y, int z, int sum, vector<int>& dp) {
    // If sum exceeds n, return an invalid value (no valid solution)
    if (sum > n) return INT_MIN;
    
    // If the sum exactly equals n, no more cuts are needed
    if (sum == n) return 0;
    
    // If already computed, return the cached result
    if (dp[sum] != -1) return dp[sum];
    
    // Recursively try to cut lengths x, y, z
    int one = solve(n, x, y, z, sum + x, dp);
    int two = solve(n, x, y, z, sum + y, dp);
    int three = solve(n, x, y, z, sum + z, dp);
    
    // Store the result in the dp array
    dp[sum] = 1 + max(one, max(two, three));

    return dp[sum];
}

int maximizeTheCuts(int n, int x, int y, int z) {
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, -1);  // DP array initialized with -1 for memoization
    
    int ans = solve(n, x, y, z, 0, dp);
    
    // If result is negative, return 0, else return the result
    return (ans < 0) ? 0 : ans;
}
```

### **Dry Run**:

Let's walk through an example where `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`.

- Start with `sum = 0`.
- At each step, we try adding `x`, `y`, or `z` to the sum:
    - First, we try adding `x = 2`: `sum = 2`.
        - From `sum = 2`, we again try adding `x`, `y`, or `z`:
            - Adding `x = 2` again gives `sum = 4` (valid solution, return 0).
            - So, `dp[2] = 1 + 0 = 1`.
    - Next, from `sum = 0`, we try adding `y = 1`: `sum = 1`.
        - From `sum = 1`, try adding `x`, `y`, or `z`:
            - Adding `y = 1` gives `sum = 2`, and the recursive solution finds that `dp[2] = 1`.
            - Adding `z = 1` gives `sum = 4` (valid solution, return 0).
        - So, `dp[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
    - Finally, we keep adding until we reach the valid solution, and the final answer is `4`.

### **Complexity Analysis**:

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Since we use memoization, each subproblem is solved once. There are `n` possible lengths (from `0` to `n`), and for each one, we check three possible cuts (`x`, `y`, and `z`).
    - Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)**.

2. **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is primarily due to the `dp[]` array, which stores results for lengths from `0` to `n`. Hence, the space complexity is **O(n)**.

---

### **Conclusion**:
This problem is an excellent example of applying dynamic programming to a recursive problem that follows the unbounded knapsack pattern. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and reusing results through memoization, we can efficiently solve the problem and maximize the number of cuts.
