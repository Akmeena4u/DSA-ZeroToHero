### Problem Summary: 1367. Linked List in Binary Tree

You are given a binary tree (`root`) and a linked list (`head`). The task is to determine if there exists a downward path in the binary tree that matches the sequence of values in the linked list. A downward path is defined as any path that starts at a node in the binary tree and proceeds downward to any of its descendants.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input:**
   - `head`: The head of a singly linked list.
   - `root`: The root of a binary tree.

2. **Output:**
   - Return `True` if the linked list's sequence is present as a downward path in the binary tree, otherwise return `False`.

3. **Constraints:**
   - A downward path can start at any node in the binary tree and must follow the child pointers downwards.
   - The sequence in the linked list must be contiguous and match a path in the binary tree exactly.

### Example

**Input:**

- `head = [4,2,8]`
- `root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]`

**Output:**

- `True`

**Explanation:**

- A downward path `[4, 2, 8]` exists in the binary tree, matching the linked list.

### Approach and Solution

To solve this problem, we need to traverse the binary tree and check for any path that matches the linked list.

#### Key Functions:

1. **`check(ListNode* head, TreeNode* root)`**
   - **Purpose:** This function checks whether the current node of the binary tree (`root`) can be the start of a downward path that matches the remaining part of the linked list (`head`).
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If `head` is `null`, it means we have matched all elements in the linked list, so return `True`.
     - If `root` is `null` or the values of `head` and `root` do not match, return `False`.
   - **Recursive Cases:**
     - Recursively check if the next node in the linked list matches with either the left or right child of the current tree node (`root->left` or `root->right`).

2. **`isSubPath(ListNode* head, TreeNode* root)`**
   - **Purpose:** This function checks if any node in the binary tree can be the start of a matching downward path.
   - **Base Case:**
     - If `root` is `null`, return `False` as no path can be found.
   - **Recursive Cases:**
     - Use the `check` function to see if the current node (`root`) can be the start of a valid path.
     - If not, recursively check the left and right subtrees.

#### Code Implementation:

```cpp
bool check(ListNode* head, TreeNode* root) {
    // If the linked list is completely matched, return true
    if (!head) {
        return true;
    }

    // If the binary tree node is null or doesn't match the current linked list node, return false
    if (!root || root->val != head->val) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check if the next node in the list can be matched in the left or right subtree
    return check(head->next, root->left) || check(head->next, root->right);
}

bool isSubPath(ListNode* head, TreeNode* root) {
    // If the tree is null, there's no path to match, return false
    if (!root) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the path starts from the current node, or in the left or right subtree
    return check(head, root) || 
           isSubPath(head, root->left) || 
           isSubPath(head, root->right);
}
```

### Summary:

- The problem is solved by first checking if the current tree node can be the start of a valid downward path using the `check` function.
- If it is not a valid starting point, we move on to the left and right children to see if they could be valid starting points using `isSubPath`.
- This method ensures that we explore all possible downward paths in the binary tree.

This approach efficiently checks for the presence of the linked list path in the binary tree by leveraging recursive tree traversal, ensuring all possibilities are considered.
