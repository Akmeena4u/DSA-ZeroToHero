### Ranking Of Selection v/s Bubble v/s Insertion Sort Algorithms:

1. **Insertion Sort**: Generally the most practical for small or nearly sorted data due to its adaptive nature and stable sorting properties. It is typically ranked highest among the three for practical use cases.

2. **Selection Sort**: While it has the same time complexity as Bubble Sort, it performs fewer swaps, which can make it slightly more efficient in practice. However, it is still inefficient for large datasets.

3. **Bubble Sort**: Often considered the least efficient of the three due to its high number of comparisons and swaps. It is more of an educational tool than a practical solution for large datasets.

In summary:
- **Insertion Sort** is the best choice among the three for its adaptability and efficiency with small or partially sorted data.
- **Selection Sort** is a good alternative when simplicity and space efficiency are important, but it's less suitable for larger datasets.
- **Bubble Sort** is mainly useful for educational purposes or very small datasets, given its less efficient nature.
