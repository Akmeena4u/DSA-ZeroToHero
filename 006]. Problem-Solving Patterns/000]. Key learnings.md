  <summary> Efficient lookup for constraints </summary>
 Efficient Constraint Handling:
  -Use data structures like sets for quick lookups to handle constraints (e.g., obstacles) efficiently.
  - Storing obstacles in a set allows for O(1) average time complexity checks to see if the robot encounters an obstacle. This is a general technique for handling constraints efficiently, especially when the constraints (like obstacles) need to be checked frequently during execution.

<summary> Simulation approach </summary>
 Simulation Problems:
**Concept**: The problem is a classic example of a simulation where you have to mimic a real-world scenario step by step based on the given instructions.
**Learning:** Simulation problems often require careful tracking of state changes (like the robot's position and direction). It's crucial to break down each command or action into discrete steps and ensure each step is executed correctly. This approach is useful in problems involving movement, state transitions, or any scenario where the sequence of actions directly affects the outcome.
