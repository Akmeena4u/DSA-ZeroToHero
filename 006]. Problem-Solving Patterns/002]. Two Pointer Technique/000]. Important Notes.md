### Understanding Time Complexity Misconceptions

- **Nested Loops Don't Always Mean \(O(n^2)\):** The presence of nested loops in a program does not inherently result in \(O(n^2)\) time complexity. The actual complexity is determined by how these loops interact and how they traverse the input data.

- **Careful Analysis is Key:** To determine the true time complexity, it's essential to analyze how the loops iterate over the data and how many times each element is processed. Misinterpreting this can lead to incorrect assumptions about the algorithm's efficiency.

- **Dependent Loop Execution:** If the execution of the inner loop is dependent on the outer loop's progress, and each element of the input is processed a limited number of times, the overall complexity may remain linear, \(O(n)\).

- **Sequential Processing:** In scenarios where the inner loop picks up where the outer loop left off, such as in your code, each element is processed exactly once. This behavior often results in a linear time complexity, despite the presence of nested loops.

- **Character-by-Character Processing:** When every character in a string is processed exactly once, even with multiple loops, the time complexity remains \(O(n)\). This ensures efficient handling of the input, regardless of the loop structure.

This refined understanding helps prevent common misconceptions and leads to more accurate assessments of an algorithm's performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### `std::stringstream` in C++ - Essential Guide

#### **Key Uses:**
1. **Converting Strings to Numbers:**
   - Convert a string representing a number into an integer or float.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::string s = "12345";
     std::stringstream ss(s);
     int x = 0;
     ss >> x;
     std::cout << x; // Output: 12345
     ```

2. **Counting Words in a String:**
   - Tokenize a string by spaces (default delimiter) to count the number of words.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::string sentence = "Hello world from C++";
     std::stringstream ss(sentence);
     std::string word;
     int count = 0;
     while (ss >> word)
         count++;
     std::cout << count; // Output: 4
     ```

3. **Extracting Numbers from Complex Strings:**
   - Parse and extract numbers from strings containing special characters or mixed data.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::string complex = "3+4i";
     std::stringstream ss(complex);
     char skip;
     int real, imag;
     ss >> real >> skip >> imag >> skip;
     std::cout << real << ", " << imag; // Output: 3, 4
     ```

#### **Notable Applications:**
- **LeetCode Challenges:**
  - *Reverse Words in a String* (LeetCode 151)
  - *Complex Number Multiplication* (LeetCode 537)
  - *Compare Version Numbers* (LeetCode 165)
  - *Defanging an IP Address* (LeetCode 1108)
  
#### **Key Points:**
- **Tokenization:** `std::stringstream` splits strings based on whitespace by default, making it ideal for tasks like word counting.
- **Efficiency:** Simplifies tasks involving string manipulation, number extraction, and tokenization.
- **Versatility:** Used extensively in competitive programming and problem-solving scenarios involving string data.

`std::stringstream` is a powerful utility in C++ that provides an easy way to handle various string manipulation tasks, making it a must-know for developers.

<summary> remove overhead of power calculations</summary>
Sure! Here's a concise explanation:

### Efficient Power Computation

The solution uses manual precomputation of powers of 2 instead of the standard library `pow` function for efficiency:

1. **Efficiency**: Precomputing powers in a loop avoids the overhead of repeated function calls and ensures quick access in constant time \(O(1)\).

2. **Boundaries and Complexity**: Precomputation with modulo \(10^9 + 7\) prevents overflow and maintains numerical stability. It keeps the overall complexity at \(O(n \log n)\), combining efficient sorting and two-pointer traversal.

### Code Snippet

```cpp
vector<int> power(n);
power[0] = 1;
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    power[i] = (power[i-1] * 2) % M;
}
```

- **Initialization**: `power[0]` is set to 1.
- **Computation**: Subsequent powers are computed iteratively, doubling the previous value and applying the modulo operation.

### Summary

Manual precomputation is efficient and avoids overflow, providing a fast and scalable solution for large inputs.
