### 1. **Sliding Window**
- The Sliding Window pattern is used to perform operations on a specific window size of a data structure like an array or linked list. It starts from the first element and shifts right, adjusting the window size according to the problem. This pattern is commonly used for problems where you need to find the longest or shortest subarray or a specific value.

### 14. Topological Sort

Topological Sort is a powerful algorithm used to determine a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For instance, if event ‘B’ is dependent on event ‘A’, then in a topological sort, ‘A’ would appear before ‘B’.

#### How the Topological Sort Pattern Works:

1. **Initialization:**
   - **Graph Representation:** Store the graph in adjacency lists using a HashMap. Each key in the HashMap represents a node, and its corresponding value is a list of nodes that depend on it.
   - **In-degree Calculation:** Use another HashMap to track the in-degrees of all vertices (i.e., the number of edges directed towards each vertex). 

2. **Building the Graph and Calculating In-Degrees:**
   - Construct the graph from the input and populate the in-degrees HashMap. This step ensures that for each node, we know how many other nodes need to come before it.

3. **Finding All Sources:**
   - **Identify Sources:** A source is any node with an in-degree of ‘0’. These nodes do not depend on any other node, making them the starting points in the topological order. Store all sources in a Queue.

4. **Sorting:**
   - **Processing Sources:**
     - **Add to Sorted List:** Start with a source node, add it to the sorted list.
     - **Explore Children:** Retrieve all child nodes from the graph that depend on the current source.
     - **Update In-degrees:** Decrement the in-degree of each child by 1 since we have processed one of their prerequisites.
     - **Enqueue New Sources:** If any child’s in-degree drops to ‘0’, it becomes a new source and is added to the Queue.
   - **Repeat:** Continue this process until the Queue is empty, and you have a fully sorted list.

#### How to Identify the Topological Sort Pattern:

- The problem involves a graph with no directed cycles (i.e., it’s a Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG).
- You're asked to update or process objects in a specific, dependent order.
- There’s a need to determine a sequence that respects dependencies.

#### Problems Featuring the Topological Sort Pattern:

- **Task Scheduling (Medium):** Determine the order of tasks that respect their dependencies.
- **Minimum Height of a Tree (Hard):** Find the optimal sequence of nodes to minimize tree height.
