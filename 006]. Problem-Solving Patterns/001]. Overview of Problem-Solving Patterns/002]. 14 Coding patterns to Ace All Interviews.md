### 14. Topological Sort

Topological Sort is a pattern used to solve problems involving Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The topological sort of a graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge \( u \rightarrow v \), vertex \( u \) comes before \( v \) in the ordering. This pattern is useful when you need to find an order in which tasks should be performed based on given dependencies.

#### How the Topological Sort Pattern Works:

1. **Identify All Incoming Edges (In-Degree):** Start by counting the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.
2. **Add Vertices with Zero In-Degree to a Queue:** All vertices with zero in-degree are added to a queue, as they have no dependencies and can be processed immediately.
3. **Process Each Vertex:** Dequeue a vertex from the queue, add it to the topological order, and reduce the in-degree of its neighboring vertices by 1.
4. **Add New Vertices with Zero In-Degree to the Queue:** If any neighbor’s in-degree becomes zero after decrementing, add it to the queue.
5. **Continue Until All Vertices Are Processed:** Repeat the process until all vertices are included in the topological order.

If the graph contains a cycle, it is not possible to generate a topological sort, as there will be vertices that never reach an in-degree of zero.

#### How to Identify Topological Sort Problems:

- You’re given a set of tasks, and each task may have dependencies on other tasks.
- You need to find a valid sequence to perform all tasks.
- The problem is modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

#### Problems Featuring Topological Sort Pattern:

- **Course Schedule (medium):** Determine if it is possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites.
- **Alien Dictionary (hard):** Determine the order of characters in an alien language given a sorted dictionary of words.

#### Example Use Case:
Imagine you have a set of tasks with dependencies, like baking a cake. Some tasks (like mixing ingredients) must be done before others (like baking in the oven). Topological sorting will help you determine the correct sequence of these tasks.

This concludes the list of common coding patterns, including Topological Sort, which is crucial for dealing with tasks and dependencies in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
