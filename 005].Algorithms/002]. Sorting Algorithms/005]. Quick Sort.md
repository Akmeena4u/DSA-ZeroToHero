### Quick Sort Algorithm Overview

Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that works as follows:

1. **Choose a Pivot**: Select an element from the array to act as a pivot. The choice of pivot can influence the algorithmâ€™s performance.
2. **Partition**: Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot come before it and elements greater than the pivot come after it.
3. **Recursively Sort**: Apply Quick Sort recursively to the sub-arrays formed by the partition.
4. **Concatenate**: Combine the sorted sub-arrays and pivot to get the fully sorted array.

### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to partition the array based on the pivot
int partition(int arr[], int s, int e) {
    int pivot = arr[s];
    int cnt = 0;

    // Count elements less than or equal to pivot
    for (int i = s + 1; i <= e; i++) {
        if (arr[i] <= pivot) {
            cnt++;
        }
    }

    // Place pivot at its correct position
    int pivotIndex = s + cnt;
    swap(arr[pivotIndex], arr[s]);

    // Rearrange elements around pivot
    int i = s, j = e;
    while (i < pivotIndex && j > pivotIndex) {
        while (arr[i] <= pivot) {
            i++;
        }
        while (arr[j] > pivot) {
            j--;
        }
        if (i < pivotIndex && j > pivotIndex) {
            swap(arr[i++], arr[j--]);
        }
    }

    return pivotIndex;
}

// Recursive Quick Sort function
void quickSort(int arr[], int s, int e) {
    if (s >= e) 
        return;

    int p = partition(arr, s, e);

    // Recursively sort left and right sub-arrays
    quickSort(arr, s, p - 1);
    quickSort(arr, p + 1, e);
}

int main() {
    int arr[10] = {2, 4, 1, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9};
    int n = 10;

    quickSort(arr, 0, n - 1);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - **Average Case**: O(n log n) - This occurs when the pivot divides the array into roughly equal halves.
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2) - This occurs when the pivot is the smallest or largest element, leading to unbalanced partitions.
  - **Best Case**: O(n log n) - Similar to average case if the pivot consistently divides the array into equal parts.

- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) - Due to the recursive call stack.

### Important Interview Questions and Answers

1. **Explain the Quick Sort Algorithm.**
   - **Answer**: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by selecting a pivot, partitioning the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, and then recursively sorting the sub-arrays.

2. **What is the time complexity of Quick Sort?**
   - **Answer**: Quick Sort has an average and best-case time complexity of O(n log n). In the worst case, it can degrade to O(n^2), especially if the pivot choices are poor.

3. **How do you choose a pivot in Quick Sort?**
   - **Answer**: The pivot can be chosen in various ways, such as the first element, the last element, the middle element, or using more advanced methods like the median-of-three. The choice of pivot can affect the algorithm's performance.

4. **What is the partitioning process in Quick Sort?**
   - **Answer**: Partitioning involves rearranging the array so that elements less than the pivot are on one side and elements greater than the pivot are on the other side. The pivot is then placed in its correct position in the sorted array.

5. **How does Quick Sort handle duplicate elements?**
   - **Answer**: Quick Sort handles duplicates by placing all elements equal to the pivot in the same partition. Depending on the partitioning strategy, these duplicates can end up in either the left or right sub-array.

6. **What are the advantages of Quick Sort?**
   - **Answer**: Quick Sort is generally faster than other O(n log n) algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort due to its smaller constant factors. It also has better cache performance and is in-place.

7. **What are the drawbacks of Quick Sort?**
   - **Answer**: Quick Sort's worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) can be problematic, especially with poor pivot choices. It is also not a stable sort, meaning it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements.

8. **How can you improve the performance of Quick Sort?**
   - **Answer**: Performance can be improved by using better pivot selection methods (e.g., median-of-three), and by implementing randomization or introspective sort (a hybrid algorithm).

9. **Describe the base case of the Quick Sort recursion.**
   - **Answer**: The base case occurs when the sub-array has one or zero elements, which means it's already sorted and no further sorting is needed.

10. **What is the space complexity of Quick Sort?**
    - **Answer**: The space complexity of Quick Sort is O(log n) due to the recursive call stack. This assumes that the partitioning is done in-place without additional data structures.

11. **How does Quick Sort compare to Merge Sort?**
    - **Answer**: Quick Sort is generally faster due to better cache performance and in-place sorting, but it can have a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). Merge Sort has a guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity but requires additional space.
