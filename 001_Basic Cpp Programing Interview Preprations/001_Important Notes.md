### Interview Question

### Describe the origin of C++ and its evolution over the years. What were the key milestones in its development also provide examples of real-world applications of C++ and list some companies that actively use C++ in their technology stack.?

**Answer:**

- C++ originated in the early 1980s as an enhancement to the C programming language. Bjarne Stroustrup began working on "C with Classes" at Bell Labs in 1979, aiming to add object-oriented features to C. The language was renamed C++ in 1983, with the "++" symbol signifying the increment operator in C, hinting at an improved version of C.

- Key milestones in the development of C++ include:
