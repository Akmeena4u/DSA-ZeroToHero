> - C++ originated in the early 1980s as an enhancement to the C programming language. Bjarne Stroustrup began working on "C with Classes" at Bell Labs in 1979, aiming to add object-oriented features to C. The language was renamed C++ in 1983, with the "++" symbol signifying the increment operator in C, hinting at an improved version of C.
