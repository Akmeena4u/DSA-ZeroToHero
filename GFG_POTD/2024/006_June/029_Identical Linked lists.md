### Problem Overview
You are given two singly linked lists, and the task is to determine whether these two lists are identical. Two linked lists are considered identical if they contain the same elements in the same order.

### Example
**Input:**
- LinkedList1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
- LinkedList2: 99 -> 59 -> 42 -> 20

**Output:** `false`
- Explanation: The two linked lists have different elements, hence they are not identical.

### Constraints
- The length of the lists is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).

### Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the longer list.
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1), as we are not using any extra space other than a few pointers.

### Solution Explanation

#### Function Signature
```c
bool areIdentical(struct Node *head1, struct Node *head2);
```

#### Steps and Logic
1. **Traverse Both Lists:**
   - Use two pointers, `head1` and `head2`, to traverse through the two linked lists simultaneously.
2. **Compare Data:**
   - For each node, compare the data in `head1` and `head2`.
   - If the data in the current nodes are different, return `false` immediately since the lists are not identical.
3. **Move to Next Nodes:**
   - Move both pointers to their respective next nodes.
4. **Check for List Termination:**
   - After exiting the loop, check if both pointers have reached the end (`NULL`).
   - If both pointers are `NULL`, it means both lists have the same length and all corresponding nodes matched. Return `true`.
   - If one pointer is `NULL` and the other is not, it means the lists are of different lengths. Return `false`.

#### Detailed Code
```c
bool areIdentical(struct Node *head1, struct Node *head2) {
    // Traverse both lists
    while (head1 != NULL && head2 != NULL) {
        // Compare the data in the current nodes
        if (head1->data != head2->data)
            return false; // Data mismatch
        
        // Move to the next nodes
        head1 = head1->next;
        head2 = head2->next;
    }

    // Check if both lists have reached their ends
    return (head1 == NULL && head2 == NULL);
}
```

### Key Points to Remember
- **Simultaneous Traversal:** Traverse both lists at the same time to ensure the order of elements is checked.
- **Immediate Return on Mismatch:** If a data mismatch is found at any node, return `false` immediately.
- **Final Check for Length:** After traversing, ensure both lists have the same length by checking if both pointers are `NULL`.

### Edge Cases
- Lists of different lengths.
- Lists with the same length but different data at some nodes.
- Identical lists with the same data and structure.
- Lists with only one element, which can either be the same or different.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the longer list. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used (pointers).
