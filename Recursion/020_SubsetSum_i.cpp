/*
Given a list arr of N integers, return sums of all subsets in it.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {2, 3}
Output:
0 2 3 5
Explanation:
When no elements is taken then Sum = 0.
When only 2 is taken then Sum = 2.
When only 3 is taken then Sum = 3.
When element 2 and 3 are taken then 
Sum = 2+3 = 5.
