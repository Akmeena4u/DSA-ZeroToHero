### Converting a Complete Binary Tree to a Max Heap

Converting a complete binary tree to a max heap involves modifying the binary tree so that it satisfies the max heap property, where each node is greater than or equal to its children.

### Steps and Code Explanation

The process involves two main steps:

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Traverse the binary tree in inorder fashion and collect node values.
2. **Postorder Traversal**: Traverse the binary tree in postorder fashion and assign the collected values from the inorder traversal to the nodes.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

#### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
};

// Function to perform inorder traversal and collect node values
void inorder(Node* root, vector<int>& in) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;
    
    inorder(root->left, in);
    in.push_back(root->data);
    inorder(root->right, in);
}

// Function to perform postorder traversal and assign collected values to nodes
void postorder(Node* root, vector<int>& in, int& index) {
    if (root == NULL)
        return;
    
    postorder(root->left, in, index);
    postorder(root->right, in, index);
    
    root->data = in[index++];
}

// Function to convert a complete binary tree to a max heap
void convertToMaxHeapUtil(Node* root) {
    vector<int> in;
    inorder(root, in);   // Step 1: Collect values in inorder
    int index = 0;
    postorder(root, in, index);   // Step 2: Assign values to nodes in postorder
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - The `inorder` function traverses the binary tree in an inorder manner (left, root, right) and stores the node values in the `in` vector.
   - This traversal ensures that node values are collected in ascending order if the binary tree was initially a BST (Binary Search Tree). For a complete binary tree, the order of values is not guaranteed.

2. **Postorder Traversal**:
   - The `postorder` function traverses the binary tree in a postorder manner (left, right, root) and assigns the collected values from the `in` vector to the nodes.
   - This ensures that the node values from the `in` vector are assigned to the nodes in a way that maintains the max heap property in the final heap.

3. **Conversion to Max Heap**:
   - The `convertToMaxHeapUtil` function combines the above two steps. It first collects all the node values in the `in` vector using the `inorder` function.
   - It then assigns these values to the nodes using the `postorder` function, ensuring that the final tree satisfies the max heap property.

### Key Points:

- **Inorder Traversal**: Collects node values in a vector. This step gathers all the node values without regard to their positions in the tree.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Assigns collected values to nodes. This step ensures that the values are assigned to nodes in a postorder manner, which helps in maintaining the heap structure.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: Assumed to be a complete binary tree where all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
- **Max Heap Property**: Ensures that each node is greater than or equal to its children, and the largest value is at the root of the heap.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Heap Property Maintenance**: Ensure that the original tree structure is preserved during the conversion.
- **Space Complexity**: The code uses extra space for storing node values in the `in` vector.
- **Time Complexity**: The operations involve two tree traversals, making the overall time complexity O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

This approach provides a systematic way to convert a complete binary tree into a max heap while maintaining the heap properties.
