### Problem Statement
 Determine if a given array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order and then rotated some number of positions.

### Approach

1. **Find Rotation Points:** Traverse the array to count the number of rotation points (where an element is greater than the next element).
2. **Validate:** The array is sorted and rotated if there is exactly one or zero rotation points.

### Algorithm

1. Traverse the array and count the number of rotation points.
2. Return `true` if there is exactly one or zero rotation points; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool checkSortedAndRotated(const vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 1) return true; // Single element array is always valid.

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n]) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count <= 1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2};
    vector<int> nums2 = {2, 1, 3, 4};
    vector<int> nums3 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    cout << checkSortedAndRotated(nums1) << endl; // Output: 1 (true)
    cout << checkSortedAndRotated(nums2) << endl; // Output: 0 (false)
    cout << checkSortedAndRotated(nums3) << endl; // Output: 1 (true)

    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) - Single traversal to find rotation points.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space usage.

### Notes 
- The array has multiple places where the order breaks. This suggests that the array cannot be obtained from a single rotation of a sorted array. Each break point indicates a new discontinuity in the sequence, which means it's been manipulated in more complex ways.
- Example: [2, 1, 3, 4] has breaks between 2 and 1, and 3 and 4. More than one break means the array wasn't just rotated but altered in other ways.
