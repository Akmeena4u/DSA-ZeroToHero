### Find Unique element
### 1. **Sorting Approach**

**Algorithm:**
1. **Sort the Array:** Sort the array in ascending order.
2. **Check for Discrepancy:** Traverse the sorted array in steps of  k  and compare elements at positions  i and i+k-1 . If they differ, the element at position i  is the unique element.

**Code:**

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findUnique(int a[], int n, int k) {
        sort(a, a + n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
            if (i + k - 1 >= n || a[i] != a[i + k - 1]) {
                return a[i];
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (for sorting)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (sorting in place)

### 2. **XOR Approach**

**Algorithm:**
1. **Use XOR Operation:** XOR all the elements in the array.
2. **Analyze XOR Result:** Since XOR-ing a number with itself cancels it out, and XOR-ing a number with zero leaves it unchanged, the result will be the unique number which does not have a pair.

**Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findUnique(int a[], int n, int k) {
        int unique = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            unique ^= a[i];
        }
        return unique;
    }
};
```

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:**  O(n)  (single pass through the array)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (constant space for XOR operation)

### **Note:**
- **Sorting Approach** is straightforward but requires sorting, which is O(nlog n).
- **XOR Approach** is more efficient in terms of time complexity, achieving O(n) time, but it assumes that only one element is unique while all other elements appear  k  times.

Choose the approach based on the problem constraints and efficiency requirements.
